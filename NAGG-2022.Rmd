## Outline

### "You can't have the Bayesian omelet without breaking some eggs."--Leonard (Jimmie) Savage 

<br>

- Brief history of emperor goose management
- Theta-logistic integrated population model 
  - Data and priors (**breaking the eggs**)
  - Results after five hunting seasons (to spring 2022)
- Using the posterior for management decision making (**the omelet**)
  - Risk management and expected utility

## Brief history of emperor goose management 
- fall bag limits reduced from 6 to 2 in 1985
- fall season closed in 1986
- spring season closed in 1987
<br>
- in 2015, population index allowed harvest
<br>
- in 2016, management plan revised: 
  - new management index (YKD Coastal Zone Breeding Pair Survey)
  - new harvest management decision thresholds
  - fall and spring-summer seasons opened in 2017

## Brief history of emperor goose management: what we knew in 2016

## The Theta-logistic model: 2016
- In the 2016 the USFWS (Dooley et al. 2016, Osnas and Frost 2016) used this model to estimate harvest potential and guide harvest management decision rules (closure thresholds)  
- used to estimate population parameters ($\boldsymbol{r}_{max}$, $\boldsymbol{K}$, $\boldsymbol\Theta$) and MSY  
- Actual management decision rules were determined based on negotiation between the all stakeholders (USFWS, ADFG, and Native Caucus)

## The Theta-logistic model
State process
$$E[N_{t+1}] = N_t + N_t \boldsymbol{r} \left[1 - \left(\frac{N_t}{\boldsymbol{K}}\right)^\boldsymbol{\theta} \right] - \frac{f(H_t, N_t)}{(1 - c)}$$
\newline
$$N_{t+1} \sim LogNormal(log(E[N_{t+1}]), \boldsymbol\sigma_n)$$
$$H_t \sim Normal(\bar H_s, \sigma_{h})$$
\newline
Observation process: data
$$Y_{obs,t} \sim Normal(\boldsymbol{q} N_t, \sigma_{Yobs,t})$$

$$H_{obs,t} \sim Normal(H_t, \sigma_{Hobs,t})$$

## The Theta-logistic model
Priors: "breaking the eggs" = informative priors

$$ \{\boldsymbol{r}, \;\boldsymbol{K}, \;\boldsymbol{\theta}, \;\boldsymbol{q}, \;\boldsymbol c, \;N_1, \;\boldsymbol\sigma_n, \;\boldsymbol{ \bar H}_s, \;\boldsymbol\sigma_h \}$$
\newline
$$\boldsymbol{ \bar H}_s \sim LogNormal(a, b)$$
\newline
In 2016:
$$Open: a = log(11250), b = 0.2$$
$$Closed: a = log(4081), b = 0.1$$

## Using the posterior: prediction

## Using the posterior

* What is the best closure threshold?  
    *Answer: maximize expected utility = The omelet  
  
  $$max_a [E [ U(H,N,a) ] = \frac{1}{S}\sum_{i}^{S} \sum_{t}^{T} U(H_t,N_t, a_t |  parameters_i)$$

## Conclusions

* harvest is less than originally hypothesized in 2016
* large uncertainty in yield potential due to:
  * demographic parameters
  * realized harvest
  * survey data
* use posterior to manage risk
  * risk-neutral MSY closure is near current closure level

\newline
We are currently eliciting objectives and risk tolerance of stakeholders
