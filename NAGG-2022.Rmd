## Outline

### "You can't have the Bayesian omelet without breaking some eggs."--Leonard (Jimmie) Savage 

<br>

- Brief history of emperor goose management
- Theta-logistic integrated population model 
  - Data and priors (**breaking the eggs**)
  - Results after five hunting seasons (to spring 2022)
- Using the posterior for management decision making (**the omelet**)
  - Risk management and Expected Utility

## Brief history of emperor goose management 
- bag limits reduced from 6 to 2 in 1985
- fall season closed in 1986
- spring season closed in 1987
<br>
- in 2015, population index allowed havrest
<br>
- in 2016, management plan revised: 
  - new management index (YKD Coastal Zone Breeding Pair Survey)
  - new harvest management decision thresholds
  - fall and spring-summer seasons opened for 2017

## The Theta-logistic model
- In the 2016 the USFWS (Dooley et al 2016, Osnas and Frost 2016) used this model to understand sustainable harvest and predict optimal harvest management decision rules (closure thresholds).  
\newline
- Actual management decision rules were determined based on negotiation between the all stakeholders (USFWS, ADFG, and Native Caucus) 

## The Theta-logistic model
- commonly used for harvest management  
  * fisheries, polar bear, whales, waterfowl
  * used to estimate population parameters
    * growth rate ($\boldsymbol{r}_{max}$)
    * carrying capacity (population size without harvest, $\boldsymbol{K}$)
    * $\boldsymbol\Theta$, 'non-linear density-dependence'
    * these determine equilibrium population size for a given harvest level (MSY)

## The Theta-logistic model
State process
$$E[N_{t+1}] = N_t + N_t \boldsymbol{r} \left[1 - \left(\frac{N_t}{\boldsymbol{K}}\right)^\boldsymbol{\theta} \right] - \frac{H_t}{(1 - c)}$$
\newline
$$N_{t+1} \sim LogNormal(log(E[N_{t+1}]), \boldsymbol\sigma_n)$$
$$H_t \sim Normal(\bar H_s, \sigma_{h})$$
\newline
Observation process: data
$$Y_{obs,t} \sim Normal(\boldsymbol{q} N_t, \sigma_{Yobs,t})$$

$$H_{obs,t} \sim Normal(H_t, \sigma_{Hobs,t})$$

## The Theta-logistic model
Priors: "breaking the eggs" = informative priors

$$ \{\boldsymbol{r}, \;\boldsymbol{K}, \;\boldsymbol{\theta}, \;\boldsymbol{q}, \;\boldsymbol c, \;N_1, \;\boldsymbol\sigma_n, \;\boldsymbol{ \bar H}_s, \;\boldsymbol\sigma_h \}$$

$$\boldsymbol{ \bar H}_s \sim LogNormal(a, b)$$
